Hello! My Name is Aamna Ansari 
"I created this company portfolio as part of my practice assignment for HTML and CSS. 
This project was assigned by Sir Ameen Alam from PIAIC, and it helped me refine my front-end development skills. 
The design includes a fully responsive layout, animations, and a modern UI/UX design approach."

Thanks! Hope you like my work 
Happy Coding....
